    "The process of splitting a dataset into three subsets, namely the training set, the validation set, and the test set, is a crucial step in developing machine learning models. Each subset serves a specific purpose in training and evaluating the model. Here's an explanation of each term and its importance:\n",
    "\n",

    "3.Test Set:\n",
    "\n",
    "The test set is another separate subset of the data that the model has never seen during training or validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is used to assess the model's performance and generalize its capabilities to new, unseen data.\n",

    "he model's performance on the test set provides an estimate of how well it would perform on real-world data.\n",

Here's how unsupervised learning can be used for anomaly detection:\n",

    "\n",
    "Example Algorithm: Local Outlier Factor (LOF)\n",
    "\n",
    "Autoencoders:\n",
    "Autoencoders are neural networks trained to reconstruct their input data. Anomalies are instances that don't reconstruct well. An autoencoder trained on normal data will have higher reconstruction error on anomalies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Isolation Forest:\n",
    "Isolation Forest creates a random forest of isolation trees. Anomalies are isolated quicker in a tree, thus requiring fewer splits. The average path length to isolate a data point is used as an anomaly score.\n",

    "Probabilistic Models:\n",
    "Unsupervised probabilistic models can capture the distribution of normal data. Data points that have a low probability under the learned distribution are flagged as anomalies.\n",

    "Dimensionality Reduction:\n",
    "Techniques like PCA (Principal Component Analysis) or t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) can help visualize and detect anomalies by highlighting data points that deviate from the general data distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensemble Methods:\n",
    "Combining multiple anomaly detection techniques can provide more robust results by leveraging the strengths of different approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, unsupervised anomaly detection involves finding patterns that deviate significantly from the norm without relying on labeled anomalies. The choice of method depends on the nature of the data, the types of anomalies you're expecting, and the trade-off between false positives and false negatives. It's important to fine-tune parameters and validate the approach to ensure reliable anomaly detection performance."
